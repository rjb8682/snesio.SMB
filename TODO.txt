Have each client maintain a UDP mailbox
The server can issue a "stop" message by dropping a bit in these mailboxes
That way we can avoid all clients checking in a stale result (20 seconds wasted for each client that didn't win the race)

Each client writes a "dont_kill_me" file while they're playing a level
Delete the file once results are checked in
Use presence of this file to avoid killing the clients at a bad time (otherwise, waste 10s per 300s)
Alternatively, write a file whose name is a timestamp
Killscript only kills if it started within N seconds
(this is bad because it allows stale results)
The kill script could write a file to send a warning to the clients!
That way the client doesn't request a new level when it's about to be killed (two-way comunication)
