Have each client maintain a UDP mailbox
The server can issue a "stop" message by dropping a bit in these mailboxes
That way we can avoid all clients checking in a stale result (20 seconds wasted for each client that didn't win the race)

Each client writes a "dont_kill_me" file while they're playing a level
Delete the file once results are checked in
Use presence of this file to avoid killing the clients at a bad time (otherwise, waste 10s per 300s)
Alternatively, write a file whose name is a timestamp
Killscript only kills if it started within N seconds
(this is bad because it allows stale results)
The kill script could write a file to send a warning to the clients!
That way the client doesn't request a new level when it's about to be killed (two-way comunication)

Explore the effects of how much variable name length affects communication time (specifically in the neural network)

Let's graph the neural networks! This would be great to have on the website

Create a "diff" between the last best network and the current best:
*why* did the new one perform better? Victories, frames, distance, per level basis (22 rows)

Save neural networks in the DB -- at least the best ones
would be great for historical playback + diffing networks
60kb * 300 = 1.8mb per generation. Not the worst. Could save representative sample (>= average)

Run server with LuaJIT! Supposed to be significantly faster than 5.1.

Calculate a "frames checked in per second metric":
(average of time since last result * total frames spent playing all 22 levels on current result)
