===================== URGENT ==================
Allow selecting which genome to play in demo mode

Fix server freeze when large amount of clients (add socket queue)

Run server with LuaJIT! Supposed to be significantly faster than 5.1:
CHUNK APART SAVE FILES SO WE CAN LUAJIT (serialize subtables individually?)

Design DB

Normalize x, y velocities (they don't seem to be used until very late in evolution)

Partition levels using greedy sorting algorithm

Kill crashed emulators periodically

README file that the run script opens with big text that says people
should feel free to log out and use these machines (in ascii!)

===================== COMING UP ==================

Create a "diff" between the last best network and the current best:
*why* did the new one perform better? Victories, frames, distance, per level basis (22 rows)

Once you're done, tell user how long it took us to train a neural net to perform that well

Idea for stats pipeline:
Write all statistics from server to standard out
Open a pipe to another process that takes in statistics and writes them to form usable by nginx
(e.g. takes stats, converts to JSON, writes files)

Fix all statistics that rely on time average

Explore the effects of how much variable name length affects communication time (specifically in the neural network)

Add fitness function to experiment config

Speed optimizations: stop trashing the lua garbage collector

Profile server, see where we need to focus (also check GC)
Profile client

Consider faster serialization (Ser ? )

===================== DREAMS.EXE ==================

Crazy Imagine idea: make your own networks?

Strip down BizHawk, run headless?

Save neural networks in the DB -- at least the best ones
would be great for historical playback + diffing networks
60kb * 300 = 1.8mb per generation. Not the worst. Could save representative sample (>= average)

Consider keeping clients connected and using socket.select

===================== COMPLETE =====================
===========================
DONE AND UNDONE
Have each client maintain a UDP mailbox
The server can issue a "stop" message by dropping a bit in these mailboxes
That way we can avoid all clients checking in a stale result (20 seconds wasted for each client that didn't win the race)
===========================

===========================
DONE (clients kill themselves, server respects it
Each client writes a "dont_kill_me" file while they're playing a level
Delete the file once results are checked in
Use presence of this file to avoid killing the clients at a bad time (otherwise, waste 10s per 300s)
Alternatively, write a file whose name is a timestamp
Killscript only kills if it started within N seconds
(this is bad because it allows stale results)
The kill script could write a file to send a warning to the clients!
That way the client doesn't request a new level when it's about to be killed (two-way comunication)
===========================

===========================
DONE (sort of, I'd like legitimate PDFs of the structure)
Let's graph the neural networks! This would be great to have on the website
===========================

===========================
IN PROGRESS
Calculate a "frames checked in per second metric":
(average of time since last result * total frames spent playing all 22 levels on current result)
===========================

===========================
DONE
Write lua script that scores a human playing
(basically, just cut out the neural network part)
Can use for estimating human-level Mario ability
Also use as a demo booth for imagine (who's better? your or the computer)
===========================

===========================
DONE
Imagine: play as mario does
===========================

===========================
DONE (demo mode)
Client option to request full genomes rather than genome.network, that we we can watch how the network changes as we evolve from generation zero (great for imagine)
DEMO OPTION: always send the best genome!!! (new request type) -- watch the network evolving!!
===========================

======================
DONE
FIX LEVELS DISPLAY
(half-results display second half on first half)
======================

=====================
DONE
Histogram and averages need *full* genome results
=====================

====================
DONE
Decay for simulataneous requests
Fixes issue where we get stuck if MAX_SIMULTANEOUS_CLIENTS all go down at once
====================

=========================
DONE
CACHE SERIALIZING NETWORKS!!!!
Why serialize the same network 22 times?
=============================

==========================
DONE
https://github.com/pkulchenko/serpent
Turn some settings off for speed
==========================
