Make a script that returns the name of the latest backup file
Half stale counters

Automate entire server start process
-- Creates backup directory structure
-- Starts demo server on some known port
-- Demo mode needs a GUI to select ports (easily switch between demos)
-- Store all hyperparameters inside a server config file (stored inside the backup dir()
-- lua server.lua resume=name_of_run, where <name_of_run> is a known run to resume
-- lua server.lua <config filename> creates a new run from the config file, moves that file to the new backup dir, etc

Client genome count needs to be fractional (half level = 0.5)
